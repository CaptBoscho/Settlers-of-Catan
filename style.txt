 
 Coding Style:
	Use 2 spaces in place of tabs
	Everything sameline
	variables: pascalCase
	functions: pascalCase()
	classes: CamelCase
	 
 Filepath:
	packages: lowercase
 	In the src folder, there will be three folders - client, server, and shared.
We will make subpackages as needed to further organize as needed.
 
 Other:
 	IDE: IntelliJ
 	Put as much on the same line as possible (e.g. curly braces, else's, etc.)
